Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| :------------ | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes sparating each header cell.

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the

raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | less      | pretty     |
| :------- | :-------- | :--------- |
| still    | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |
